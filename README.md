# Student Behavior Tracking App
A web app for teachers to track students' behavior.

My mom is a middle school teacher who is incredibly fond of using technology in the classroom. She's currently using an iOs app, [ClassDojo](classdojo.com), to track her student's behavior. She likes its features, but was frustrated with the limited options and asked me to build her a web app with similar functionality, customized to her needs.

## What is the goal of the project?
The goal of this project is to deliver a web app that accurately tracks students' behavior. Each day, a student will start out with 100 points; as the day goes on, the user (my mom/the teacher) will subtract or add points of a set or customizable value. As more data is gathered, the user will have a visual representation (i.e. graph) of the students' behavior over time. An additional feature will be hosting multiple classes of students within one user's account.

## Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
Teachers, specifically of elementary or middle school, who would like to keep a daily, accurate record of their students' behavior for semester reports.

## What are your personal learning goals?
I hope to solidify my understanding of the intersections of web technologies. I want to extend my comfort zone by challenging myself to attempt new things by exploring documentation and not limiting myself to the possibilities of which I'm already aware.

## What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
I'll be using **Ruby on Rails** and **MVC patterns** to build my web app. I'll be utilizing **CSS3** and **JavaScript** for the UI. I may make use of **CarrierWave** to simplify and expedite the onboarding process for my users. I will attempt to deploy to **Heroku** since I want to ship my app for live use. I'll be using **RSpec** to test my app's functionality.

## What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
I'll likely be using JavaScript, so that will have to be enabled in the browser. Other than that, there shouldn't be any dependencies.

## What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?
Success will be a deployed, functional app that meets my mom's needs in the classroom. I'll know the app is "done" when the app's core features are built and I have passing tests with at least 90% coverage.
