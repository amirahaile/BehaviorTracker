# Hot Spot
This web app uses GPS to save the location of your parked car. When you're ready to return to your vehicle, open the app and 'play the game'; the hotter you get, the closer you are!

## What is the goal of the project?
Create a fun web app that utilizes the entire stack and tests my understanding of various web technologies.

## Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
Anyone who has trouble finding their parked car!

## What are your personal learning goals?
I'm hoping this project will give me the opportunity to become more familiar with the languages and technologies I'll be implementing. Specifically, I'd like to explore the animations possible with CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery and become more familiar with the Google Maps API. I'd also appreciate getting more practice with making HTTP requests.

## What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
I'll be using **HTML5**, **CSS3** + **Sass**, with **JavaScript** + **jQuery** for front-end structure, styling, and animation. The back-end will be handled by **Ruby on Rails** and its **MVC** architectural pattern, supported by a **PostGres** database (**SQLite** in the testing environment) in order to deploy to **Heroku**.

## What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
The user must have a browser available on their mobile phone with JavaScript enabled.

## What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?
Success is achieved if the user not only finds their car, but has fun doing it. This project will be considered 'done' when a user can successfully locate their car using this web app alone.
